The scatterplot matrix visualizations pairwise correlations for multi-dimensional data; each cell in the matrix is a scatterplot. This example uses Anderson's data of iris flowers on the Gasp√© Peninsula. Scatterplot matrix design invented by J. A. Hartigan; see also [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [GGobi](http://www.ggobi.org/). Data on *Iris* flowers collected by Edgar Anderson and published by Ronald Fisher.
